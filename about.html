My name is Dorette Schutte and I am 36. I am a mother of a lovely 8year old boy who is making a career change. 
I previously worked as a Document Controller on Medupi Power Station for 10 years. I am ambitious and driven. I am 
currently busy with Intro to Programming and looking forward to do the Java Bootcamp. I love watching sport, playing 
with our dogs and spending time with family.
